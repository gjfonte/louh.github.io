IMPROVE TEXT!

BUG		On smaller windows, absolutely positioned elements won't scroll with
        document. This includes the dropdown menu and many things on the project
        menu screen.
        
        Experimentation on fixing this is in "styles2" file however:
        - Changing elements to relative positioning starts causing unpredictable
          behavior in browsers. It seems to work ok in Firefox BUT
        - In Opera/Chrome making <h3> relatively positioned makes the menu
          scroller too small in width - likely to be pushed to the left.
        - Making the dropdown elements relatively positioned causes it to
          appear at different height levels in different browsers, and also
          affects the positioning of the <h2> title
        - The dropdown menu itself, when relatively positioned, will cause
          the project text to move out of the way when it's opened.
         
        Further tests will be needed to make this work before it can go live.

BUG		Implement custom scrolls bars (ie. jscrollpane) on overflow divs
		They are needed in two locations - the drop down menu and
		on porfolio info area. Currently jscrollpane doesn't appear to be
		working at all and scroll bars show up depending on browser used

FEATURE	Add PDF download links for portfolio
		Also add PDF downloads for specific projects, if they have them

================================================================================
==
==   MEDIUM PRIORITY 
==
================================================================================

FEATURE	Needs a better way of navigating projects while viewing another project.
		The drop down menu has some complaints.
		Suggestions:
		 - 	Consider making a thumbnail browser on the left
		 -	Consider next project / previous project navigation

FEATURE Use cleaner URLS without hash - ie. /portfolio/lamodafresca rather
		than /#portfolio/lamodafresca
		
MISC	Consider using Typekit instead of Cufon for font replacement.
		Typekit currently has League Gothic but not Avenir, also doesn't look
		as good.
		
BUG		Pressing back to go from the resume page to a project page causes
		the project page to appear on top of the resume.


================================================================================
==
==   LOW PRIORITY 
==
================================================================================

BUG		FadeIns on project loading is laggy, usually just appears instantly.
		Removing Cufon.replace() helps to reduce lagginess, but does not
		fix all instances of lag. May not be fixable.

HACK	IE8 porfolio box prioritizes % width of window over pixel min-width, 
		currently overridden in special IE stylesheet to prevent breakage.

FEATURE	Consider wrapping image scrollers if they are longer than the visible
		box area; otherwise display the whole thing and remove arrows.

FEATURE Dynamically generate portfolio data from DB - A good idea but 
		currently a lot of work for very little visible benefit

BUG		Clicking different nav buttons too quickly causes col2 content 
		to disappear.

==
================================================================================

11/19/2011	- Layout styles for tablets and mobiles implemented
				(Media Query / Less Framework 4) - Some style cleanup still
				neeeded

11/16/2011	- Update Avenir font with missing punctuation

11/14/2011	- One year later, version 3 is live. Lots of improvements

			- Content width is no longer variable, and vertical scroll 
				is allowed
			- Resume is displayed in HTML form rather than embedded PDF

12/16/2010	- Project loading now done exclusively through changing the hash
			  and relying on the BBQ hashchange plugin - thus preventing the
			  loadProject() from firing twice. Should fix load flickering.
			- Project delimiter changed from "?" to "/"
			- Portfolio/Resume now fadein/out rather than slide up/down - 
			  didn't fit the aesthetic
			- framework for loading in project graphics as they are loaded have
			  been written in, but it doesn't work yet.
			- Caption for project images are now displayed on image itself
			  rather than in fixed position on window
			- Projects that overflow the y-dimension of the window now have
			  scrollbars, but layout will break when scrolling since too many 
			  elements are positioned absolutely

12/11/2010  - Added a check on scroller arrows so that it no longer overscrolls
			  during rapid clicking or if right or left arrow keys are pressed.
			- Removed "Photography" link and web projects to target
			  focus more toward architecture/planning projects

			  over the project images.

				one is provided)
			- Cufon updated to 1.09l
			- New "Current Projects" on the main menu

11/30/2010	- Project arrows are fixed on IE8/Win. Unpredictable arrow
				show/hide behavior should be fixed as well.
			- Timing of project loading is improved so most visual transition
				bugs should be fixed.
			- Previous/Next browser navigation now work properly in most 
			 	browsers (still broken in Chrome/Mac)
			- Menu left/right arrows are brighter
			- Keybound letters (a/r/p) will no longer work if Ctrl or Command
				(on Macs) are pressed at the same time
			- Title image is now officially "Corvalis Studio"

11/29/2010	- Removed Cufon font replacement on project data and descriptions
				to make it more readable
			- Project image left and right arrows changed to be clearer and
				obscure less of images

11/28/2010  - Adjusted menu scrolling to account for change to block elements
			- Removed loading gif for returning to menu
			- corvalis.net/portfolio and corvalis.net/resume now redirect to
				proper locations
			- Menu arrows and portfolio image arrows will now disappear when 
				it has reached the edge of items in the scroller
			- Fixed image height attribute typos on several projects
			- Changed title of page to include my name - see if this helps
				google search rankings
			- Menu image scroller on Opera/Mac appears to be fixed now

11/27/2010	- Fixed menu scrollers having an extra whitespace on Chrome/Safari
			- Fixed menu thumbnail images being rendered as inline elements
				rather than block elements
			- New IE-only stylesheet, IE8 was not showing opacity after
				"filter" CSS rule was removed
			- Forced IE8 to use a fixed-width portfolio box as a temporary fix
				to an issue where max-width of 60% was being prioritized,
				causing the porfolio box to disappear off the right side of the
				page on skinny windows

	- Lots of updates and small fixes in between here

11/15/2010  - New porfolio update released

==   DOCUMENTATION
==
================================================================================

loadProject()
	- queue() / dequeue() is necessary to keep project from loading into the
		window before it fades in/out
	- delay(x) keeps it from trying to fade in at the same time as fading out
		from previous commands
	- Cufon.refresh() is needed to get title fonts to display correctly.
		Note that it is also solely responsible for fadeIn() to not happen
		correctly.
